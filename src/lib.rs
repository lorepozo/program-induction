//! A library for program induction and learning representations.

//! # Bayesian program learning with the EC algorithm
//!
//! Bayesian program learning (BPL) is a generative model that samples programs, where programs are
//! generative models that sample observations (or examples). BPL is an appealing model for its
//! ability to learn rich concepts from few examples. It was popularized by Lake et al. in the
//! 2015 _Science_ paper [Human-level concept learning through probabilistic program induction].
//!
//! The Exploration-Compression (EC) algorithm is an inference scheme for BPL that learns new
//! representations by _exploring_ solutions to tasks and then _compressing_ those solutions by
//! recognizing common pieces and re-introducing them as primitives. This is an iterative algorithm
//! that has been found to converge in practice. It was introduced by Dechter et al. in the 2013
//! _IJCAI_ paper [Bootstrap learning via modular concept discovery].  The EC algorithm can be
//! viewed as an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for approximate maximum a posteriori (MAP)
//! estimation of programs and their representation. Roughly, the exploration step of EC
//! corresponds to the expectation step of EM and the compression step of EC corresponds to the
//! maximization step of EM.
//!
//! A domain-specific language (DSL) \\(\mathcal{D}\\) expresses the programming primitives and
//! encodes domain-specific knowledge about the space of programs. In conjunction with a weight
//! vector \\(\theta\\), the pair \\((\\mathcal{D}, \\theta)\\) determines a probability
//! distribution over programs. From a program \\(p\\), we can sample a task \\(x\\). Framed as a
//! hierarchical Bayesian model, we have that \\(p \\sim (\\mathcal{D}, \\theta)\\) and \\(x \\sim
//! p\\).  Given a set of tasks \\(X\\) together with a likelihood model \\(\\mathbb{P}[x|p]\\) for
//! scoring a task \\(x\\in X\\) given a program \\(p\\), our goal is to jointly infer a DSL
//! \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) and latent programs for each task that are likely (i.e. "solutions").  For
//! joint probability \\(J\\) of \\((\\mathcal{D},\\theta)\\) and \\(X\\), we want the
//! \\(\\mathcal{D}\^\*\\) and \\(\\theta\^\*\\) solving:
//! \\[
//! \\begin{aligned}
//! 	J(\\mathcal{D},\\theta) &\\triangleq
//!         \\mathbb{P}[\\mathcal{D},\\theta]
//!         \\prod\_{x\\in X} \\sum\_p \\mathbb{P}[x|p]\\mathbb{P}[p|\\mathcal{D},\\theta] \\\\
//!     \\mathcal{D}\^\* &= \\underset{\\mathcal{D}}{\\text{arg}\\,\\text{max}}
//!         \\int J(\\mathcal{D},\\theta)\\;\\mathrm{d}\\theta \\\\
//!     \\theta\^\* &= \\underset{\\theta}{\\text{arg}\\,\\text{max}}
//!         J(\\mathcal{D}\^\*,\\theta)
//! \\end{aligned}
//! \\]
//! This is intractable because calculating \\(J\\) involves taking a sum over every possible
//! program. We therefore define the _frontier_ of a task \\(x\\), written \\(\\mathcal{F}\_x\\),
//! to be a finite set of programs where \\(\mathbb{P}[x|p] > 0\\) for all \\(p \\in
//! \\mathcal{F}\_x\\) and establish an intuitive lower bound:
//! \\[
//!  J\\geq \\mathscr{L}\\triangleq \\mathbb{P}[\mathcal{D},\\theta]
//!     \\prod\_{x\\in X} \\sum\_{p\\in \\mathcal{F}\_x}
//!         \\mathbb{P}[x|p]\\mathbb{P}[p|\\mathcal{D},\\theta]
//! \\]
//! We find programs and induce a DSL by alternating maximization with respect to the frontiers
//! \\(\\mathcal{F}\_x\\) and the DSL \\(\\mathcal{D}\\). Frontiers are assigned by enumerating
//! programs up to some depth according to \\((\\mathcal{D}, \\theta)\\). The DSL \\(\mathcal{D}\\)
//! is modified by "compression", where common program fragments become invented primitives.
//! Estimation of \\(\\theta\\) is a detail that a representation must define (for example, this is
//! done for probabilistic context-free grammars, or PCFGs, using the inside-outside algorithm).
//!
//! In this library, we represent a [`Task`] as an [`observation`] \\(x\\) together with a
//! log-likelihood model (or [`oracle`]) \\(\\log\\mathbb{P}[x|p]\\). We additionally associate
//! tasks with a type, [`tp`], to provide a straightforward constraint for finding programs which
//! may be solutions. Programs may be expressed under different representations, so we provide a
//! representation-agnostic trait [`EC`]. We additionally provide two such representations: a
//! polymorphically-typed lambda calculus in the [`lambda`] module, and a probabilistic context
//! free grammar in the [`pcfg`] module.
//!
//! See the [`EC`] trait for details and an example.
//!
//! # Genetic programming
//!
//! Our primary resource is the 2008 book by Poli et al.: [_A Field Guide to Genetic Programming_].
//!
//! Genetic programming (GP) applies an evolutionary algorithm to a population of programs. The
//! evolutionary algorithm involves _mutations_ to selected individuals and _crossover_ between
//! pairs of selected individuals. Individuals are selected with a tournament, where a random
//! subset of the population is drawn and the best individual is selected (note: there are
//! alternative selection strategies). Crucial to GP is the notion of _fitness_, a way of measuring
//! how well individuals perform.
//!
//! In this library, we represent a [`Task`] as a fitness function in the [`oracle`] field, and a
//! constraint for relevant programs as a type in the [`tp`] field. The [`observation`] field is
//! not utilized by GP (we recommend setting it to [`unit`]). Programs may be expressed under
//! different representations, so we provide a representation-agnostic trait [`GP`]. We provide an
//! implementation for probabilistic context free grammars in the [`pcfg`] module.
//!
//! See the [`GP`] trait for details and an example.
