/// Implementors of `GP` must provide methods for [`genesis`], [`mutate`], [`crossover`]. A
/// [`Task`] provides a fitness function via its [`oracle`]: we adopt the convention that smaller
/// values are better (so one can think of the [`oracle`] as providing a measure of error). To opt
/// out of the default tournament-based selection, implementors may override the [`tournament`]
/// method.
///
/// Typically, you will interact with this trait using the [`init`] and [`evolve`] methods on
/// existing implementations, such as [`pcfg::Grammar`].
///
/// The provided methods (namely [`init`] and [`evolve`]) manipulate a _population_, which is a
/// sorted list of programs according to fitness. If you otherwise modify the population such that
/// it is no longer sorted appropriately, these methods will behave incorrectly.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// This example has a lot of code, but it is quite straightforward. Given a PCFG and an evaluator
/// for sentences, a task is created by measuring proximity of an evaluted sentence to some target.
/// We finally pick some parameters and evolve a population for a few hundred generations.
